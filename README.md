Designed and implemented an inverter, NAND gate, and current mirror circuits using Cadence Virtuoso. Created detailed schematics and layouts, ensuring optimal circuit functionality and efficiency. Conducted simulations to analyze key performance metrics such as propagation delay, power consumption, and current flow characteristics. Verified design accuracy by performing Design Rule Checks (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) checks, ensuring compliance with fabrication standards. This process emphasized precision in design and validation, contributing to reliable and efficient circuit performance.
